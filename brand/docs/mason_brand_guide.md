# Mason Brand Guidelines

---

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the official brand guidelines for **Mason**. This document provides the essential standards for communicating the Mason brand identity consistently and effectively. Mason represents knowledge, security, and enlightenment in the complex world of decentralized finance (DeFi). The brand aesthetic is professional, trustworthy, and modern, drawing its core visual elements from the established identity of Assure DeFi.

Our mission is to empower users with clarity and confidence, symbolized by the hooded "Mason" figure—a guardian of knowledge, illuminating the path forward with the light of an open book and the wisdom of the stars.

## 2. Logo

The Mason logo is the primary identifier of our brand. It combines a mysterious, knowledgeable figure with symbols of security (the shield) and enlightenment (the star and book). It is designed to be versatile, recognizable, and representative of our core values.

### Primary Logo

The primary logo includes the shield icon with the "MASON" wordmark below it. This is the preferred version for most applications.

### Horizontal Logo

For wide-format applications where the primary logo may not fit well, the horizontal version should be used. It features the icon to the left of the wordmark.

### Icon / Brandmark

The icon can be used as a standalone brandmark in situations where the brand is already well-established, such as on app icons, social media profiles, or as a favicon.

## 3. Color Palette

The Mason brand color palette is directly derived from the official Assure DeFi brand identity, ensuring consistency and leveraging the established trust of the parent brand. The palette is a high-contrast combination of a deep, authoritative navy, a luminous gold, and clean white.

### Primary Colors

| Color | Hex | RGB | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navy** | `#0A0724` | `10, 7, 36` | Primary background, text, dark logo elements |
| **Gold** | `#E2D243` | `226, 210, 67` | Primary accent, logos, CTAs, highlights |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | `255, 255, 255` | Text on dark backgrounds, light logo elements |
| **Black** | `#000000` | `0, 0, 0` | Alternative dark color for maximum contrast |

### Color Usage Examples

- **Gold on Navy**: The primary combination for logos and key branding elements.

## 4. Typography

Typography is a critical element of the Mason brand identity. The selected fonts are modern, legible, and versatile, reflecting our commitment to clarity and professionalism. We use a combination of a geometric sans-serif for headings and a classic serif for body text.

### Primary Typeface (Headings)

**Poppins** is our primary typeface, used for all headings and major titles. Its geometric forms and clean, modern aesthetic create a strong, professional impression.

- **Font:** [Poppins on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)
- **Weights:** Bold (700), SemiBold (600)
- **Usage:** H1, H2, H3, major calls to action

**Example:**

# Heading 1: Poppins Bold

## Heading 2: Poppins SemiBold

### Secondary Typeface (Body Text)

**Noto Serif** is our secondary typeface, used for body copy, paragraphs, and other long-form text. Its classic serifs and high readability make it ideal for conveying detailed information clearly and elegantly.

- **Font:** [Noto Serif on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif)
- **Weights:** Regular (400), Italic (400)
- **Usage:** Body paragraphs, blockquotes, captions

## 5. Logo Usage Guidelines

To maintain the integrity and consistency of the Mason brand, it is crucial to use the logo correctly. These guidelines outline the rules for clear space, minimum size, and unacceptable uses.

### Clear Space

Always maintain a minimum clear space around the logo to ensure its visibility and impact. The clear space should be equal to the height of the "M" in the MASON wordmark. No other elements, such as text, images, or other graphics, should intrude into this space.

*(Imagine a border around this image representing the clear space)*

### Minimum Size

To ensure legibility, the logo should not be reproduced at a size smaller than the recommended minimums. 

- **Primary & Horizontal Logo:** The wordmark "MASON" should not be smaller than 24px in height for digital applications or 0.25 inches for print.
- **Icon/Brandmark:** The icon should not be smaller than 48x48 pixels for digital applications.

### Unacceptable Uses

To protect the brand's integrity, never alter the logo in any of the following ways:

- **DO NOT** change the colors of the logo.
- **DO NOT** stretch, condense, or distort the logo in any way.
- **DO NOT** add drop shadows, glows, or other visual effects to the logo.
- **DO NOT** place the logo on a background that does not provide sufficient contrast.
- **DO NOT** rotate the logo.
- **DO NOT** use the logo as part of a sentence or phrase.
