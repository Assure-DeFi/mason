# PM Domain Knowledge

This file provides domain-specific context for the PM agent when analyzing this codebase.

**Auto-generated sections** are marked with `[AUTO]`. These are populated by `/pm-review` on first run.
**User-editable sections** can be customized to improve analysis quality.

---

## Project Overview [AUTO]

**Mason** is a developer productivity suite that helps solo developers and full-stack developers ship better code faster through AI-assisted workflows.

## User Personas [AUTO]

### Primary User

- **Role**: Solo developer / Full-stack developer
- **Goals**: Ship quality code quickly, stay focused on high-value work
- **Pain Points**:
  - Manual code review is slow and blocks shipping
  - Hard to prioritize what to work on next

## Domain Priorities [AUTO]

<!-- Weights for different improvement domains -->

| Domain       | Priority | Notes                                            |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| frontend-ux  | High     | UX polish is critical for developer adoption     |
| api-backend  | Medium   | Backend stability supports the CLI and dashboard |
| reliability  | High     | Must be dependable for daily developer workflows |
| security     | Medium   | Important but not the primary differentiator     |
| code-quality | Medium   | Maintains long-term maintainability              |

## Off-Limits Areas [AUTO]

<!-- Areas that should NOT receive improvement suggestions -->

- None specified (PM can suggest improvements anywhere)

---

## Technical Constraints [USER-EDITABLE]

<!-- Technical limitations the PM should consider -->

- **Backwards compatibility**: Must maintain compatibility with existing CLI and API users
- **Privacy-first architecture**: User data stays client-side or in their own DB, never in central DB
- **Minimize dependencies**: Avoid adding new runtime dependencies unless absolutely necessary

## Known Technical Debt [AUTO]

<!-- Auto-detected from TODO/FIXME comments -->

Minimal technical debt - approximately 1 TODO comment found in application code.

## Improvement Guidelines

### Prefer

- Improvements aligned with domain priorities above
- Changes that reduce user friction
- Security hardening
- Performance optimizations for critical paths

### Avoid

- Major architectural changes without discussion
- Adding new dependencies for minor gains
- Cosmetic changes without functional benefit
- Breaking changes to public APIs

## Notes for PM Agent

When analyzing this codebase:

1. **Respect priorities**: Use the Domain Priorities table to weight suggestions
2. **Honor off-limits**: Never suggest changes to Off-Limits Areas
3. **User-first**: Prioritize improvements that benefit the primary user persona
4. **Pragmatic**: Suggest improvements achievable with current resources
5. **Incremental**: Prefer small, safe changes over big-bang refactors

Remember: The best improvement is one that ships and provides value.
