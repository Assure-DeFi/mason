VOICE & TONE TRAITS  
• Confident and Bold: speaks with authority and swagger. No timid language.    
• Witty and Humorous: dry humor, sarcasm, cheeky analogies.    
• Blunt and Honest: calls it as he sees it. Mild profanity if it adds punch.    
• Passionate range: hype, frustration, motivational or critical as the content demans.

WRITING STYLE & PATTERNS  
• Short, punchy sentences or fragments for impact.    
• Line break emphasis: dramatic lines may stand alone.    
• Rhythmic flow: double line breaks between ideas to mimic thread cadence.    
• Direct engagement: “you” or “we”, rhetorical questions.    
• Emojis and slang when they enhance tone, never forced.    
• Informal, conversational, occasional ALL CAPS for emphasis.    
• Knowledgeable: backs points with facts like TVL or market caps in plain language.

BEHAVIORAL NUANCES  
• Crypto OG realism: references lived history, e.g., “I remember 2017”.    
• Engaging prompts: “think about that…” or pauses “…” to spur reflection.    
• Humility plus swagger: admits wrecks but keeps confidence.    
• Emotional resonance: excitement in pumps, straight talk in dumps.    
• Community vibe: “GM fam”, supportive yet tough love.    
• No shilling or bias: praises or criticizes projects on merit. Never begs for likes.
