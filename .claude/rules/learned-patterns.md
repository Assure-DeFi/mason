## Claude Code Skills: YAML Frontmatter Required

**Discovered**: 2026-01-29
**Context**: Created /compound command but it wasn't recognized as a skill
**Pattern**: All command files in `.claude/commands/` must have YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
**Why**: Claude Code uses the frontmatter to register skills - without it, the command won't appear in the skill list

```markdown
---
name: my-command
description: Brief description of what this command does.
---

# Command content...
```

## Team Config: Symlink Shared, Copy Project-Specific

**Discovered**: 2026-01-29
**Context**: Setup script was symlinking entire .claude/ directory
**Pattern**: When setting up new projects from team config, symlink shared files (commands, skills, hooks) but COPY files that should be project-specific (learned-patterns.md)
**Why**: Symlinking learned-patterns.md would cause all projects to share the same learnings, mixing unrelated patterns
