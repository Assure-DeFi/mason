| Domain       | Priority | Notes                      |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------- |
| frontend-ux  | High     | [Based on user priorities] |
| api-backend  | Medium   | [Based on user priorities] |
| reliability  | High     | [Based on user priorities] |
| security     | Medium   | [Based on user priorities] |
| code-quality | Medium   | [Based on user priorities] |

## Off-Limits Areas [AUTO]

<!-- Areas that should NOT receive improvement suggestions -->

- None specified

---

## Technical Constraints [USER-EDITABLE]

<!-- Optional: Add any technical limitations the PM should consider -->

- [e.g., "Must maintain backwards compatibility with v1 API"]
- [e.g., "Cannot add new runtime dependencies"]

## Known Technical Debt [AUTO]

Approximately [X] TODO/FIXME comments found in codebase.

## Improvement Guidelines

### Prefer

- Improvements aligned with domain priorities above
- Changes that reduce user friction
- Security hardening
- Performance optimizations for critical paths

### Avoid

- Major architectural changes without discussion
- Adding new dependencies for minor gains
- Cosmetic changes without functional benefit
- Breaking changes to public APIs

## Notes for PM Agent

When analyzing this codebase:

1. **Respect priorities**: Use the Domain Priorities table to weight suggestions
2. **Honor off-limits**: Never suggest changes to Off-Limits Areas
3. **User-first**: Prioritize improvements that benefit the primary user persona
4. **Pragmatic**: Suggest improvements achievable with current resources
5. **Incremental**: Prefer small, safe changes over big-bang refactors

Remember: The best improvement is one that ships and provides value.
