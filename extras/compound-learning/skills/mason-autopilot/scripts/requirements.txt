# Mason Auto-Pilot Dependencies
# These are the Python packages required for the auto-pilot scripts.
#
# Note: The scripts use only Python standard library modules for maximum
# portability. No external dependencies are required.
#
# If you need to add dependencies in the future, add them here:
# requests>=2.28.0

# Currently no external dependencies required
